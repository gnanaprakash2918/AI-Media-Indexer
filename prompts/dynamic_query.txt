You are parsing a video search query to extract both granular constraints and general entities.

CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES:
1. ONLY extract entities that are EXPLICITLY written in the query
2. DO NOT infer person names from song titles, lyrics, or movie names
3. If the query is a song/movie title, extract it as a "title" entity, NOT as person names
4. If unsure whether something is a person name, DO NOT include it as a person
5. Non-English words should be treated as titles/keywords, NOT person names

INPUT QUERY:
{query}

OUTPUT FORMAT (valid JSON only):
