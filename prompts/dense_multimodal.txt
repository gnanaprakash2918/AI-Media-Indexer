## ENTITIES (list each visible item as a separate entity)
For EACH person, clothing item, object, food, vehicle, sign — create a SEPARATE entity.

Accessory: super_category="accessory", name is the accessory, visual_details has color+material.
Object/Food/Vehicle/Other: super_category accordingly.

- Person 1 wears a red silk saree → entity(name="saree", category="traditional clothing", super_category="clothing", visual_details="red silk with gold zari border, pallu draped over left shoulder")
- Person 1 wears gold bangles → entity(name="bangles", category="jewelry", super_category="accessory", visual_details="gold, 6 thin bangles on right wrist")
