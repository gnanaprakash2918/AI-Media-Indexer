You are verifying if a video segment matches a user query.

QUERY: "{query}"

SEGMENT DESCRIPTION:
{description}

SEGMENT METADATA:
- People: {face_names}
- Location: {location}
- Actions: {actions}
- Visible Text: {visible_text}

TASK: Analyze how well this segment matches the query.

For EACH constraint in the query, determine if it's satisfied:
1. Check ALL people mentioned - are they present?
2. Check ALL clothing/accessories - do they match?
3. Check ALL actions - are they occurring?
4. Check ALL locations/brands - do they match?
5. Check temporal requirements - timing correct?

Return JSON:
{
  "match_score": 0.0-1.0,
  "constraints_checked": [
    {"constraint": "<what to check>", "satisfied": true/false, "evidence": "<why>"}
  ],
  "reasoning": "<chain of thought explaining the score>",
  "missing": ["<constraints not satisfied>"]
}
